# CSC375_Parallel_Programming
Course description by Doug Lea: "Parallel computing was once confined to the use of specially crafted parallel computers. However, increasingly, the two essential ingredients of parallelism -- programming constructs that deal with logically parallel activities, and communication across physically separate computers, are available just about everywhere. This course will mainly focus on concepts, theory, design, and implementation of concurrent and distributed software that can be employed across a variety of platforms (in particular, using Java). However, we will also discuss some classic parallel algorithms that apply only to special parallel computers."
